The Disaster Artist is based on the true story of the making of "The Room", a cult classic that is known as "The Worst Movie of All Time". The Disaster Artist follows the two protagonists, Tommy Wiseu, played by James Franco, and Greg Sestero played by Dave Franco. The two brothers give an electric performance as they depict the ludicrous story behind the making of "The Room". 

The movie begins with both Wiseu and Sestero unsuccessfully attempting to become famous actors. The two meet at an acting class and immediately form an unlikely friendship. Wiseu is an enigmatic and extremely wealthy, having an accent that he claims is from New Orleans, but is clearly not. There is little that is really known about Wiseu, such as where his wealth comes from, where he is from, or even how old he is. Sestero on the other hand is a simple wannabe actor in his mid 20s, who just wants to become famous.

After continued failures with trying to make it in Hollywood, Wiseu and Sestero eventually come up with the radical idea to create their own movie, which they will both star in. Wiseu's insanity is on full display as he makes countless nonsensical choices in the creation of the movie. The final result is a fascinating look into the creation of one of the strangest movies ever made.

Overall, I found "The Disaster Artist", to be an extremely entertaining and interesting tale. The acting was incredible and did a great job of portraying all the idiosyncrasies of the source characters. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie, but you should probably watch "The Room" beforehand, for the best viewing experience.
