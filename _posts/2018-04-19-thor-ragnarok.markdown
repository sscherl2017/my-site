"Thor: Ragnarok" is the latest addition to the Thor and Marvel canon. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, with a fun and incredibly entertaining performance as the God of Thunder. The film begins with the return of Thor's sister, Hela the Goddess of Death. Hela is intent on the conquest of the universe and it is up to Thor, the Hulk and Loki to stop her. 

Hela initially destroys Thor's hammer, which is his main source of power, and he must find a new way to channel his powers in order to return to Asgard and defeat Hela. Although this is technically an action/superhero movie, it is also incredibly funny. This is a Marvel movie that does not take itself too seriously. There are countless "serious" moments that are interrupted with jokes and humor. This results in a movie that will entertain everybody, from the comic book fans, to action fans, to those who enjoy comedy.

I found this movie to be the best comic movie that I have seen in a long time, and by far the most entertaining in the Thor series. This film definitely represents a new direction for comic book movies, but one that I am a really big fan of.
