The Quiet Place had quite a novel concept for a film. The main premise is that there are creatures on Earth who will kill anything that makes a sound. This means that in order to survive, humans must remain absolutely silent throughout their lives.

The film follows a family in their struggle to survive against the creatures that hunt them down. The family uses sign language to communicate in order to prevent themselves from being heard. 

The film had many positive aspects. The concept of the creatures that kill you if they hear you was interesting and allowed some powerful acting without the use of dialogue. Krasinski and Blunt had extremely powerful performances as they portrayed trying to keep their family together.

However, there were also numerous problems with the film, and unexplained plot points. There was never any explanation of where the creatures came from or why they wanted to kill every human being. Although I understand that movies require some suspension of disbelief, I thought that some explanation or background would have been nice. I also thought that the horror scenes weren't extremely scary and became slightly repetitive after a while. There was no time in the movie when I was genuinely scared as all the scares were, for the most part, easy to see coming.

Overall, I found "The Quiet Place", to be an interesting and entertaining horror movie that did not live up to the hype that I had heard about it.
