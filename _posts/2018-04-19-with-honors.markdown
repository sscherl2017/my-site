With Honors is a story following the protagonist Brendan Fraser playing Monty, as he attempts to graduate from Harvard with a degree with honors. The film starts out developing the character of Monty as a cynical government concentrator who has become out of touch with the everyday citizen, and believes them to be detrimental to democracy. Monty's life is turned upside down when his thesis, which he believes will allow him to graduate with honors, falls into the hand of a homeless man, named Simon, played by Joe Pesci. Simon will only give back Monty's thesis in exchange for food and shelter to help him survive the winter.

Although this story has a slightly predictable plot, it is nonetheless an enjoyable heartwarming tale of a jaded Harvard student being taught some valuable life lessons by Simon. Without Pesci's performance the movie would be infinitely weaker, Pesci's emotional and interesting portrayal of Simon is really the main strength of the movie. His character is both insightful and wise, and always has a snippet of poetry or quote that is perfect for each situation that the characters face. Simon sets the mood of the movie and drives most of the character development, including Monty's and all of Monty's roommates.

Although all of the characters are slightly over the top, and at times not the most realistic, the message of the movie still remains poignant and interesting. Although by no means a classic, "With Honors" will deliver what it promises too and will leave the viewer thinking about the messages in the movie for some time after watching it.
